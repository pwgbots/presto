# Presto: software in support of project relays

## What is a project relay?
A project relay is an innovative form of education, aiming to help students develop applied skills.    
Presto has been used in support of modeling relays until 2024. As students increasingly used generative AI
to produce models, report texts and reviews, this invalidated the calibrated rubrics that permitted summative
testing.

## Platforms
The Presto software builds on these software platforms:

* Python
* Django
* Semantic UI
